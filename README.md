I'm a Grade 11 student, full-stack developer, and AI robotics engineer based in Beijing. My passion lies in architecting end-to-end systems that solve complex, real-world problems‚Äîfrom the initial idea to the final deployment. As a proud member of **FTC Team 27570 (B.E.A.R.)**, I'm constantly exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, robotics, and software engineering.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

I believe the best way to learn is by building. Here are some of the systems I've engineered:

| Project | Description | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| üìç **[Zero-to-YOLO-Yard](https://github.com/BlueDarkUP/Zero2YoloYard)** | An **end-to-end, local-first web application** that streamlines the entire MLOps workflow. It provides a complete solution for video management, collaborative annotation, AI-assisted labeling (with **SAM 2.1**), automatic object tracking, and one-click YOLO dataset exporting. | `Python`, `Flask`, `SQLite`, `JavaScript`, `OpenCV`, `Ultralytics` |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **[FTC-Easy-TFLITE](https://github.com/BlueDarkUP/FTC-Easy-TFLITE)** | A **complete, standardized MLOps pipeline** designed to eliminate the complexity of training and deploying custom models for FTC. It provides an automated, step-by-step workflow from TFRecord datasets to verified, competition-ready `.tflite` models, including a custom **metadata injector** and a standalone model inspector to solve compatibility issues. | `Python`, `TensorFlow`, `Bash`, `Conda` |
| ü§ñ **[RM-Hunter](https://github.com/BlueDarkUP/RM-Hunter)** | An **autonomous sentry robot system** for RoboMaster, built on a multi-threaded architecture. The system uses a YOLO model for detection, a **Kalman Filter** for stable tracking and motion prediction, and a **PID + Feedforward controller** for high-precision gimbal control. It's designed to be a robust, task-driven service activated by external serial commands. | `Python`, `TensorFlow`, `Robomaster SDK`, `OpenCV` |
| üåä **[FLL-AquaHunter](https://github.com/BlueDarkUP/FLL-AquaHunter)** | An **AI-powered underwater ROV** for the FLL 2025 Innovation Project, designed to autonomously identify and capture invasive lionfish. This project integrates a YOLOv8 model with the **SORT algorithm** (Kalman Filter + Hungarian Algorithm) for persistent object tracking and uses a P-controller for visual servoing. | `Python`, `OpenCV`, `Arduino (C++)`, `SORT Algorithm` |
